### Purpose

Needed a simple markdown blog platform that could also serve as an online presence for my projects.


### Tech involved

- Gatsby - I had experience with static site generators in the past, namely Jekyll and Middleman, both being Ruby frameworks, and enjoyed their modularity and simplicity.
- React - Always been a fan of React's performance from working with it previously.
- GraphQL for querying - This was my first time using the query language. It's a refreshing way to work with data and its schema. Using GraphQL allowed me to expose only the attributes I needed for each component with page-specific queries, and integrated really well with the headmatter in markdown files.
- CSS Grid for view layout

###  Takeaways / Improvements

- Netlify - I've been hearing the hype for a while now, and the deploy process with a static site generator structure was probably faster than that of Heroku!
